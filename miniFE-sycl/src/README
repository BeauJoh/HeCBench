The SYCL port of the miniFE is based on the OpenMP4.5-opt. 
By default, we use the SYCL GPU selector to run the application on an Intel GPU. 
The source files Vector_functions.hpp and SparseMatrix_functions.hpp contain the SYCL implementations. 
Verification is always enabled by commenting "if (params.verify_solution > 0)" in driver.hpp.
Debugging can be enabled by adding the option -DMINIFE_DEBUG. 
The performance results are collected using the dimensions (128,128,128)
