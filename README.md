# oneAPI Direct Programming
This repository contains a collection of data-parallel programs for evaluating oneAPI direct programming. Each program is written with CUDA, SYCL, and OpenMP target offloading. Intel<sup>速</sup> DPC++ Compatibility Tool (DPCT) can convert a CUDA program to a SYCL program in which memory management migration is implemented using the explicit and restricted Unified Shared Memory extension (DPCT usm) or the DPCT header files (DPCT header) .


# Experiments
We compare the performance of the SYCL, DPCT-generated, and OpenMP implementations of each program. The performance results below were obtained with the [Intel OpenCL intercept layer](https://github.com/intel/opencl-intercept-layer). "total enqueue" indicates the total number of low-level OpenCL enqueue commands called by a parallel program. These enqueue commands include "clEnqueueNDRangeKernel", "clEnqueueReadBuffer", and "clEnqueueWriteBuffer". The host timing is the total elapsed time of executing OpenCL API functions on a CPU host while the device timing is the total elapsed time of executing OpenCL API functions on a GPU device. The Plugin Interface is OpenCL.  
 
## Setup
Software: Intel<sup>速</sup> oneAPI Beta08 Toolkit, Ubuntu 18.04  
Platform 1: Intel<sup>速</sup> Xeon E3-1284L with a Gen8 P6300 integrated GPU  
Platform 2: Intel<sup>速</sup> Xeon E-2176G with a Gen9.5 UHD630 integrated GPU

## Run
A script "run.sh" attempts to run all tests with the OpenCL plugin interface. To run a single test, go to a test directory and type the command "make run".
